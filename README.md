Is 3D really banksy?
====================
##Using F# to answer one of the most important questions facing humanity today - 
##is 3D, out of popular beat combo Massive Attack, really banksy?

There have been recent suggestions in the [press](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/banksy-identity-theres-a-wild-theory-the-graffiti-artist-is-3d-of-massive-attack-a7222326.html), that the identity of Banksy may in fact be Robert Del Naja,
aka 3D, based on uncanny coincidences of banksy art-works appearing in places where Massive Attack are playing. 

Some time ago, academics at Queen Mary University, London, used Geoprofiling (in R, no less), to 'prove' that
the banksy was in fact Robert Gunningham, using the locations of 140 art works in London and Bristol, and locations 
Gunningham was know to have lived in.


Setting things up
-----------------
We're going to use paket for dependency management. We'll be needing FSharp.Data and Suave, so our paket.dependencies
looks like
```
source https://nuget.org/api/v2
nuget FSharp.Data
nuget Suave 
```
To download, run '.paket/paketbootstrpper.exe' (which downloads the latest paket.exe, from github), and then '.paket/paket.exe install'.
If you've cloned the git repo, you can just run build.cmd/sh. This will download the specified dependencies to the 'packages' directory.

Getting the data
----------------
To get the data, we are going to use the HTML Type Provider from FSharp.Data. As the name implies, the HTML provider makes extracting data from HTML 
a breeze (well, most of the time, as will become apparent). You just give it a static paramter to and example of the html document you wnat to use to
generate your types (this can be a local file, or more usually a URL), and then you can bind an instance of the type to a value, thus -

```fsharp
type HtmlTypes= HtmlProvider<"http://someurl.org?page=1">
let data = HtmlTypes.Load("http://someurl.org?page=2")
```

Note, that the url/path used as the static type paramter for HtmlProvider need not be the same as the one passed to Load() - as long as the structure
of the HTML is the same. This is a feature we will make use of in getting data for Massive Attack gigs. I found a very good source for this data
[here](http://www.bandsintown.com/MassiveAttack/past_events?page=1). This page contains lists of Massive attack gigs in tables, with the below headings

```html
    <tr>
          <th class="date"><span>Date</span></th>
          <th class="venue"><span>Venue</span></th>
          <th class="location"><span>Location</span></th>
          <th class="more"></th>
    </tr>
```
So, to get our list of massive attack gigs, first we define our 'MassiveAttackScraper' type:
```fsharp
type MassiveAttackScraper = HtmlProvider<"http://www.bandsintown.com/MassiveAttack/past_events?page=1">
and if we Load()
```fsharp
let dates = MassiveAttackScraper.Load("http://www.bandsintown.com/MassiveAttack/past_events?page=1")
```
we get a value with a property Tables, one of which is 'Past Dates', containing an Array of 'Row's
```fsharp
Rows = [|(11-Nov-09 12:00:00 AM, "Le Zénith", "Paris, France Le Zénith",
               "I Was There");
              (10-Nov-09 12:00:00 AM, "Le Zénith", "Paris, France Le Zénith",
               "I Was There");
              (08-Nov-09 12:00:00 AM, "Zoppas Arena",
               "San Vendemiano, Italy Zoppas Arena", "I Was There");
              (07-Nov-09 12:00:00 AM, "Palasharp", "Milano, Italy Palasharp",
               "I Was There"); ....

val it : HtmlProvider<...>.PastDates.Row =
  (11-Nov-09 12:00:00 AM {Date = 11-Nov-09 12:00:00 AM;
                          Day = 11;
                          DayOfWeek = Wednesday;
                          DayOfYear = 315;
                          Hour = 0;
                          Kind = Local;
                          Millisecond = 0;
                          Minute = 0;
                          Month = 11;
                          Second = 0;
                          Ticks = 633934944000000000L;
                          TimeOfDay = 00:00:00;
                          Year = 2009;}, "Le Zénith",
   "Paris, France Le Zénith", "I Was There")
```
Each Row has properties Date, Venue, Location and Column4 (based on the header rows - the 4th column has no heading).
What's more, the Date property has been inferrerd to be a DateTime! This is going to be so easy, I'm almost ashamed ...

Next on the agenda, we should define a type to model our domain - no need to go over board, something like
```fsharp
//type to model things happening somewhere, at some time.
type Event =
    { Occurred : DateTime
      Name : string
      Lat : float
      Long : float 
      ImgSrc : string
    }
```
The purpose of ImgSrc will become apparent. The location column is consistently in the form 'City, Country' - from this, we need to get 
the latitude and longitude. To do so, we will use (yes) another type provider, this time FSharp.Data.JsonProvider, talking to the Bing Maps rest API.
The api takes a url of the form
```javascript
 http://dev.virtualearth.net/REST/v1/Locations?query=[city]&includeNeighborhood=1&maxResults=5&key=[bing_maps_key], and returns 
```
returning some complicated Json. I won't go into too much of the detail of the function (stolen almost entirely from [@tpetricek](https://github.com/tpetricek/new-year-tweets-2016/blob/master/app.fsx#L104)),
but essentially create the Bing JsonProvider type, with an example url
```fsharp
  let [<Literal>] BingSample = "http://dev.virtualearth.net/REST/v1/Locations?query=Prague&includeNeighborhood=1&maxResults=5&key=" + Config.BingKey  
  type Bing = JsonProvider<BingSample>
```
then, a function taking a parameter for the city of interest, build the url, and Load()
```fsharp
let locate (city:string) = 
    let url = 
    sprintf "http://dev.virtualearth.net/REST/v1/Locations?query=%s&includeNeighborhood=1&maxResults=5&key=%s" 
        (HttpUtility.UrlEncode city)  Config.BingKey
    let bing = Bing.Load(url)
```
The bing value, will contain an array of matches, with the most confident appearing first, each of which will contain co-ordinates, as a decimal array[2]. The function returns (float * float) option,
returning None, if the API returned no results. The function also caches results in a Dictionary<string,(float * float) option>, so that we don't make unnecessary calls.
